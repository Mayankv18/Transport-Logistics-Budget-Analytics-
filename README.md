Got it — since this is a **Transport & Logistics Budget Analytics Power BI dashboard project**, here’s a **professional, GitHub-ready README.md** written like a real analytics portfolio project (similar to what consulting firms like **Government of India** budget data and **Ministry of Road Transport and Highways** reporting would require).

You can **copy-paste directly into your GitHub README.md**.

# 🚦 Transport & Logistics Budget Analytics Dashboard (India)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Transport & Logistics sector budget allocation** using official Government of India budget data.
The Power BI dashboard provides a clear view of:

* Yearly budget allocation trends
* Capital vs Revenue expenditure split
* Ministry-level spending contribution
* Growth rate & YoY changes
* Performance insights for infrastructure investment

The objective is to help **policy analysts, consultants, and decision-makers** understand:

> Where money is allocated, how spending changes over time, and which areas drive infrastructure growth.
